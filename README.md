# leetcode
A repo containing leetcode solutions in python 3. Each directory corresponds to a leetcode problem with the following convention:
- **problem.md:** A scrape of the problem statement from leetcode stored in markdown.
- **solution.py:** The solution script.
- **write_up.md:** A brief summary of my approach, runtime analysis, and space complexity analysis.
- **meta.json:** Data about the problem stored in a parseable way in case I ever want to host these answers somewhere.

## Running a solution script:
Each script is self contained so to run a script, simply cd into the problem directory and run `python solution.py`. I wrote these solutions on python 3.12 but they should be pretty compatible with older verisons.
